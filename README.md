# Diamond Textile

This is a project I developed to help manage operations for a textile business.

The goal was to build a system that streamlines how textile products are cataloged and managed. It was a great opportunity to apply my development skills to a real-world retail/inventory scenario.

## What It Does

The project focuses on the core needs of a textile business:
* **Product Catalog:** Displays various fabric types, designs, and materials.
* **Inventory Management:** Tracks stock levels and product availability.
* **Order Processing:** (If applicable) Handles basic order flows or inquiries.

## The Tech Stack

I built this using the tools I rely on for robust development:
* **Language:** [e.g., Kotlin / JavaScript / Python]
* **Framework:** [e.g., Android SDK / React / Django]
* **Database:** [e.g., Firebase / MySQL / MongoDB]

## How to Run It

1.  Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/Loki-apk/Diamond-Textile.git](https://github.com/Loki-apk/Diamond-Textile.git)
    ```
2.  Open the project in **[e.g., Android Studio / VS Code]**.
3.  Install the dependencies (if needed).
4.  Run the application locally.

## Context

This project serves as a practical example of how I approach software architecture and business logic. It handles data presentation and user interaction in a clean, efficient way.
